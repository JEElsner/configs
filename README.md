# Configs

## Windows

On windows, the config repository is NOT bare, and is just a normal repository in the home directory `$home`. In addition, so that some file paths (like nvim configs) match those for linux (for git merge ease), run the setup script at `./.configs/config-repo/setup.ps1` as adminstrator to create symlinks.
